# simple-search
A search input with elegant UI, event handlers and focus handling

UNDER DEVELOPMENT. DON'T USE YET.

## Examples
Run something like npm `simplehttpserver` from root and navigate to `src/example/example.html`

TODO: 
- make `clearOnFocusOut` a boolean, not a function
- disable submission until a value exists
